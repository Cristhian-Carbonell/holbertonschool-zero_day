## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi
- A ```README.md``` file at the root of the ```holbertonschool-zero_day``` repo, containing a description of the repository
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of this project (e.g. ```0x02-vi```), describing what this project is about
- If the answer of one of the following questions needs the ```Return``` key, then use the string ```<Return>```. Example: What is the command to write current contents to a file named in the original vi call? The answer should be exactly ```:w<Return>```. Note that there is no space between w and ```<Return>```
- Your file should only contain the command, and nothing else
